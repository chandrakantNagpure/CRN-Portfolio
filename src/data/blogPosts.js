    content: `# React Component Design Patterns: Building Scalable UIs

React component design is both an art and a science. The way you structure your components directly impacts the maintainability, reusability, and scalability of your application.

## Component Composition Patterns

### 1. Container and Presentational Components

Separating concerns between data fetching and presentation:

- **Container Components**: Handle state, lifecycle, and data fetching
- **Presentational Components**: Focus purely on rendering UI based on props

### 2. Compound Components

Create flexible, reusable component APIs that work together:

- Allow consumers to compose components in different ways
- Maintain internal state coordination between related components
- Provide a clean, intuitive API

### 3. Render Props Pattern

Share code between components using a prop whose value is a function:

- Provides maximum flexibility for customization
- Enables complex logic sharing
- Great for building reusable behavior

### 4. Custom Hooks

Extract component logic into reusable functions:

- Share stateful logic between components
- Easier to test and maintain
- Compose multiple hooks together

## Component Architecture Best Practices

### Single Responsibility Principle

Each component should have one clear purpose:
- Button components handle button behavior
- Form components handle form logic
- Layout components handle positioning

### Props Design

Design clean, intuitive prop interfaces:
- Use descriptive, self-documenting prop names
- Provide sensible defaults
- Use TypeScript for better developer experience
- Validate props in development

### State Management

Choose the right state management approach:
- Local state for component-specific data
- Context for app-wide state
- External libraries for complex state needs

## Performance Optimization

### Memoization

Use React.memo and useMemo strategically:
- Prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Optimize expensive calculations
- Be mindful of dependencies

### Code Splitting

Load components only when needed:
- Route-based splitting
- Feature-based splitting
- Dynamic imports with React.lazy

### Bundle Optimization

Keep bundle sizes manageable:
- Analyze bundle composition
- Remove unused dependencies
- Use tree-shaking effectively

## Testing Strategies

### Unit Testing

Test components in isolation:
- Test behavior, not implementation
- Use Testing Library principles
- Mock external dependencies

### Integration Testing

Test component interactions:
- Test user workflows
- Verify component communication
- Test with realistic data

### Visual Testing

Catch visual regressions:
- Storybook for component documentation
- Visual regression testing
- Accessibility testing

## Conclusion

Well-designed React components are the foundation of maintainable applications. Focus on clear separation of concerns, intuitive APIs, and performance optimization to create components that scale with your application.

Remember: good component design is about finding the right balance between flexibility and simplicity. Start simple, and add complexity only when needed.`,

# The Art of Component Design: Creating Reusable UI Elements

Creating reusable components is both an art and a science. It requires balancing flexibility with simplicity, performance with features.

## Design Principles

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle

Each component should have one clear purpose:

\`\`\`jsx
// Good: Focused component
function Button({ children, variant, onClick, disabled }) {
  return (
    <button
      className={\`btn btn-\${variant}\`}
      onClick={onClick}
      disabled={disabled}
    >
      {children}
    </button>
  )
}

// Avoid: Component doing too much
function ButtonWithModalAndForm() {
  // Too many responsibilities
}
\`\`\`

### 2. Composition over Inheritance

Build complex UIs by composing simple components:

\`\`\`jsx
function Card({ children, className }) {
  return (
    <div className={\`card \${className}\`}>
      {children}
    </div>
  )
}

function CardHeader({ children }) {
  return <div className="card-header">{children}</div>
}

function CardBody({ children }) {
  return <div className="card-body">{children}</div>
}

// Usage
<Card>
  <CardHeader>
    <h2>Title</h2>
  </CardHeader>
  <CardBody>
    <p>Content goes here</p>
  </CardBody>
</Card>
\`\`\`

## Advanced Patterns

### Compound Components

\`\`\`jsx
function Tabs({ children, defaultTab = 0 }) {
  const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState(defaultTab)
  
  return (
    <TabsContext.Provider value={{ activeTab, setActiveTab }}>
      <div className="tabs">
        {children}
      </div>
    </TabsContext.Provider>
  )
}

Tabs.List = function TabsList({ children }) {
  return <div className="tab-list">{children}</div>
}

Tabs.Tab = function Tab({ children, index }) {
  const { activeTab, setActiveTab } = useContext(TabsContext)
  return (
    <button
      className={\`tab \${activeTab === index ? 'active' : ''}\`}
      onClick={() => setActiveTab(index)}
    >
      {children}
    </button>
  )
}
\`\`\`

## Testing Your Components

Always test your reusable components:

\`\`\`jsx
import { render, screen, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react'
import Button from './Button'

test('renders button with correct text', () => {
  render(<Button>Click me</Button>)
  expect(screen.getByRole('button')).toHaveTextContent('Click me')
})

test('calls onClick when clicked', () => {
  const handleClick = jest.fn()
  render(<Button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</Button>)
  fireEvent.click(screen.getByRole('button'))
  expect(handleClick).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1)
})
\`\`\`

## Conclusion

Well-designed components are the foundation of maintainable React applications. Focus on clarity, composition, and testing to create components that stand the test of time.

    content: `# Web Performance Optimization: Core Web Vitals Guide

Web performance directly impacts user experience, SEO rankings, and business metrics. Understanding and optimizing Core Web Vitals is essential for modern web development.

## Understanding Core Web Vitals

Core Web Vitals are three key metrics that Google uses to measure user experience:

### 1. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)

- Optimization strategies:
  - Minimize JavaScript execution time
  - Code splitting and lazy loading
  - Use Web Workers for heavy computations
  - Optimize event handlers

### 3. Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
- Target: < 0.1
- Measures: Visual stability
- Optimization strategies:
  - Reserve space for images and ads
  - Avoid inserting content above existing content
  - Use CSS transforms instead of layout-triggering properties
  - Set explicit dimensions for media

## Performance Optimization Techniques

### Image Optimization

Modern image optimization strategies:
- Use next-generation formats (WebP, AVIF)

Simplifies promise creation for external resolution scenarios. This feature is particularly useful for creating promises that need to be resolved from outside their initial scope, such as in event-driven architectures or complex async flows.

### 3. Temporal API Progress

While still in Stage 3, the Temporal API promises to replace the problematic Date object with a more intuitive and powerful date/time handling system. Key improvements include:
- Immutable date objects
- Better timezone handling
- Clearer API design
- More predictable behavior

## Modern Development Patterns

    content: `# Building Scalable REST APIs: Design Principles and Implementation

Building APIs that can scale to millions of requests while maintaining excellent performance and developer experience requires careful planning and adherence to proven design principles.

## RESTful API Design Fundamentals

### Resource-Based URL Design

Design URLs around resources, not actions:
- Use nouns for resource names
- Implement proper HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)

- PATCH: Partial resource updates
- DELETE: Remove resources

### Status Code Standards

Implement meaningful HTTP status codes:
- 200: Successful GET, PUT, PATCH
- 201: Successful POST (resource created)
- 204: Successful DELETE (no content)
- 400: Bad request (client error)
- 401: Unauthorized
- 403: Forbidden
- 404: Resource not found
- 409: Conflict (duplicate resource)
- 500: Internal server error

## API Architecture Patterns
